# 0.1.0

- **First release: `pip install assurance` installs every command-line tool**, and `uvx assurance`
  runs one without installing anything. No code of its own — it depends on `assurance-cli`,
  `assurance-deps`, `assurance-budget` and `assurance-authority`, and declares the `assurance`
  command so `uvx` and `pipx` find it on the package that was named.
